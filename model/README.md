#Model

Store code used to train models here.

Code stored here must read from `OUTPUT_FOLDER` in case you are not using a database.

Model results depend on you, for example: store model pickles and predictions in `OUTPUT_FOLDER` and log model parameters to a database.

Use [experiments](experiments/) to store experiment files for every model you train.

Use [tests](tests/) folder to test your model training code.
